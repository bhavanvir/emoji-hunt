# ECE 471 Project (Emoji Hunt)

- Given an example of a random emoji (one of
~300) your algorithm must find the
location of all matching emojis in the
generated image
- You will select which augmentations will be
applied to the emojis in the generated image
to make it harder or easier
- Your goal is to solve for as many of these
augmentations as possible
- Your final solution will be marked for ingenuity
and effectiveness
